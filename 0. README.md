### SQL/ETL Final Project
# Introduction
In the digital era, effective data management is essential for a business to thrive and make informed decisions. To aid in this, a SQL infrastructure can be created to allow a business to store, organize, retrieve and analyze data. The goal of this project was to provide everything needed to create this infrastructure for a theoretical startup company.
# Design
Once it was decided that the focus of this database would be sales, relevant tables were determined and the relational nature of them was mapped. The data type was also determined. https://drawsql.app/ was used to visualize all of this, as seen in the image below.

There is a customers table, with information about all of the customers, including contact info, where they are from, and how long they have been a customer. There is an orders table with information about each order, including the date the order was placed, the address it is being sent to, and the subtotal. There is a order_list table, which expands upon the orders table and includes information about the individual items in the order. And there is a products table, with information about each of the products the company sells, such as item description, cost and, sale price. The lines between tables in the image above show how these tables relate to each other.
# Creation
The next step was to move into Microsoft SQL Server and create the database.
